# Color Flipper Project

Welcome to the Color Flipper project! This simple web application built with JavaScript allows you to switch to different colors by clicking a button. It's a fun and straightforward project that demonstrates the power of JavaScript for interactive web development.

## Features

- Clicking the "CLICK ME" button will change the background color of the page to a random color.
- The random color is generated using JavaScript's Math.random() method and displayed as a hexadecimal color code.
